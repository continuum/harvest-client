# Harvest Plugin

This is an open source project, built in Santiago of Chile by Mauricio Offermann from Continnuum Chile,
http://www.continuum.cl.

The initial main idea was to build a Eclipse plugin, but for many reasons the final project is only a
harvest console client. The way I use it is to assign shortcuts in Eclipse IDE to admin Daily entries.

If you want to continue this project feel free to do.

## Installation

1ยบ Open file authentication.properties, set your account information and save it.
2ยบ Run the file run.bat 

If you have problems to run, probably you need to install Java and set the JAVA_HOME enviroment variable.
